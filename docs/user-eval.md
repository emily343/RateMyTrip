## 01: Testing the User-Experience of City Search and Review

### Meta

Status
: **Done** 

Updated
: 18-07-2025

### Goal

Our goal is to evaluate how intuitive it is for new users to search for a city and submit a review. We want to find out whether users can find the city they are looking for quickly and whether writing a review is simple for them. This will help us improve our overall design and user experience. 

### Method

To evaluate the usability of our website, we would ask a group of university students who have not used the site before to complete the following tasks: 

1. Search for a city of your choice
2. Submit a Review
3. View other Reviews on the city page

We would then evaluate how intuitive the process was for them and if they encountered any issues during the process, such as not knowing how to submit the review etc.. 

### Expected Results

We expect that most user will find the search process very intuitive. Because we implemented a list of all the cities, students will know which cities they can look up. 
The review form might be slightly long, or it might not be clear how many points to give at first.

### Implications

Based on the feedback, we plan to make the review form even more intuitive by writing a short paragraph on how it works. We could also add even more cities, so students will most certainly find the city they are looking for.
