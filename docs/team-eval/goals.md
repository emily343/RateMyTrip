# Our group-goals:

We aim to build a well-rounded web app with an appealing User-Interface and -Experience that is helpful and attractive to our target audience. While doing so we plan to fulfill all formal project-requirements and are ambitious to deliver an overall good project.



# Sarah’s goals:

My personal goal is to overall implement a successful project and deepen my understanding and skills in web development. Since I have never created a web app prior to this course, certain aspects of the process are unfamiliar to me. Therefore, I aim to get familiar with them to a level where I can comfortably use and apply them, not only in this course but also in the future.


# Emily’s goals:

My personal goal is to gain a deeper understanding of web development after successfully completing this course. I want to be able to understand the concepts of this course and apply them to our project. We chose a travel-related idea for our project because it is something we are both very interested in, which will help us stay motivated and make it easier to meet the requirements while still having fun.
