# Our group-goals

We aim to build a well-rounded web application with an appealing User-Interface and -Experience that is helpful and engaging for our target audience. Throughout the development process, we intended to meet all formal project requirements and are ambitious to deliver a cohesive and polished result.



# Our Personal goals
## Sarah’s goals:

My personal goal is to overall implement a successful project and deepen my understanding and skills in web development. Since I have never created a web app prior to this course, certain aspects of the process are unfamiliar to me. Therefore, I aim to get familiar with them to a level where I can comfortably use and apply them, not only in this course but also in the future.


## Emily’s goals:

My personal goal is to gain a deeper understanding of web development after successfully completing this course. I want to be able to understand the concepts of this course and apply them to our project. We chose a travel-related idea for our project because it is something we are both very interested in, which will help us stay motivated and make it easier to meet the requirements while still having fun.


# Goals achieved and missed
We are very satisfied with the web application we created and are proud of the results. Throughout the project, we significantly deepened our understanding of web development and learned many new skills. We successfully implemented the main goals we had set for ourselves and were able to meet key requirements. Overall, we are happy with both our teamwork and the final product.
