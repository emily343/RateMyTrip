## [Sarah Abdulsayed] - review 1

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Emily demonstrated a structured and responsible approach to the development our project. Her work-style contributed to an efficient workflow.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Her reliability had a positive impact on the team dynamic.  We both were able to work on our part as decided without fearing having to pick up the other's part. This made collaboration both smooth and productive.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

I don't really have any but it would be helpful if in the future we both  could aim to finish her tasks a bit earlier, so thereâ€™s more time for team discussions and feedback before the next steps.
