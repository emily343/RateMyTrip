## Expand Features
Adding more interactive elements, such as user notifications or advanced search filters, could improve our appâ€™s usability. 
When planing this project we initially needed much time to fully understand the project and all the technical skills behind it. Therefore we first had to build a solid base of knowldge, which limited us. For the next time, we will find that we have a solid grasp of the basics, which will allow us to be able to plan more complex features right from the beginning and successfully implement them.
