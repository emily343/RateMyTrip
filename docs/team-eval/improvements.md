## Expand Features
Adding more interactive elements, such as user notifications or advanced search filters, could improve our appâ€™s usability. 
When planing this project we initially needed much time to fully understand the project and all the technical skills behind it. Therefore we first had to build a solid base of knowldge, which limited us. For the next time, we will find that we have a solid grasp of the basics, which will allow us to be able to plan more complex features right from the beginning and successfully implement them.

## Use Base Template
One thing we noticed during the development was that a lot of our html code was repetitive. For example, we manually added the same navigation bar to every page instead of using a base.html template from the beginning. Even though the code works and it is not wrong, it led to a lot more code in each template and small changes were time consuming. In future projects, we would try to structure the code more cleanly from the start.
