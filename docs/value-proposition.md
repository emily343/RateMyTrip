## The problem

Students often struggle to find trustworthy and relatable information about cities they consider for their Erasmus semester or other travels across Europe. It’s particularly difficult to get insights into aspects that matter most to young people such as student life, nightlife, affordability, or cultural activities from a student’s perspective.

## Our solution

CityRate is a web app that creates a student and traveling community that helps each other through user-generated reviews and ratings. Users can search for cities they are interested in and get a nice overall assessment through the rating of different categories such as vibe, cost or activities and further explore the city through different personal statements of fellow travelers. With a search function users can find reviews that relay information on subjects they are interested in.
Each user can contribute by sharing their own insights and experiences, helping to build a reliable knowledge base tailored specifically to the needs of Erasmus students and other young travelers.

## Target user

The app can be helpful to any students or travelers who enjoy sharing their thoughts and connecting with a like-minded community, but the ratings are based on topics specifically tailored to young adults and students who value authentic, experience-based insights.

## Customer journey

1.	Homepage:

The user starts at the homepage, where they have to log in or create an account.  After a successful login, the user can search for cities they are interested in.

2.	City Overview

After searching for a city, the user sees an introduction of the chosen city. A summary of the ratings in different categories (e.g., student life, activities, nightlife, etc.) is displayed. Below that, the user can scroll through experiences and ratings shared by other travelers. With a search function users can find reviews that provide information on subjects they are interested in.

3.	Leave a Review 

Students can share their own experience by adding a personal review. They can add a text about the city and rate the city in different categories. After submitting a review, they receive a confirmation message.
