## The problem

Travelers often struggle to find trustworthy and relatable information and personal experiences about cities they plan to visit. It's often hard to get insights about specific travel interests like culture, nightlife, or affordability that might especially be important to younger travelers.

## Our solution

RateMyTrip is a web app that creates a traveling community that helps each other through user-generated reviews and ratings. Users can search for cities they are interested in and get a nice overall assessment through the rating of different categories such as vibe, cost or activities and further explore the city through different personal statements of fellow travelers. With a search function users can find reviews that relay information on subjects they are interested in.
Each user can contribute their own experiences to the cities they have already visited.

## Target user

The app can be helpful to any traveler who enjoy sharing their thoughts and connecting with a like-minded travel community, but the ratings are based on topics specifically tailored to young adults and students who value authentic, experience-based insights.

## Customer journey

1.	Homepage:

The user starts at the homepage, where they have to log in or create an account.  After a successful login, the user can search for cities they are interested in.

2.	City Overview

After searching for a city, the user sees an overview oft the chosen city. A summary of the ratings in different categories (e.g., activities, nightlife, etc.) is displayed. We also want to recommend things to do around the city. Below that, the user can scroll through experiences and ratings shared by other travelers. With a search function users can find reviews that provide information on subjects they are interested in.

3.	Leave a Review 

Travelers can share their own experience by adding a personal review. On this page, they can add a text about the city and rate the city in different categories. After submitting a review, they receive a confirmation message.
