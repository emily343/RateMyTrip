# RateMyTrip
Our project for Web-Development
RateMyTrip is a web app that creates a traveling community that helps each other through user-generated reviews and ratings. Users can search for cities they are interested in and  
get a nice overall assessment through the rating of different categories such as vibe, cost or activities and further explore the city through different personal statements of fellow travelers. With a search function users can find reviews that relay information on subjects they are interested in. 
Each user can contribute their own experiences to the cities they have already visited.
